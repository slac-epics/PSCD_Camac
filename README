Releases
-----------
This package has been successfully tested with code built
under EPICS R3.14.8.2 and RTEMS 4.7.1  and 4.9.3 (Tills versions).

Build Instructions
--------------------
The file RELEASE_SITE is included in the file configure/RELEASE
as a way to decouple the directory tree for base,modules and extensions
in the automatic build script used by LCLS. Therefore, to build
this package the users must edit the file RELEASE_SITE, and define
the EPICS path for base, modules and exensions on your system.

PSCDApp
--------
This application containes the driver for the PSCD board,
which is a PCI-Module, that is piggy backed on the CPU board,.
Use of this module by an IOC Application requires the users to 
add the following line to their application configure/RELEASE file:

PSCDCAMAC_MODULE_VERSION=Development
PSCDCAMAC=$(EPICS_MODULES)/PSCD_Camac/$(PSCDCAMAC_MODULE_VERSION)

The user will also need to add the PSCDlib libarary and PSCD.dbd
database definitions file to the application src/Makefile to
include the set of CAMAC-to-VME functions which are used by the
individual CAMAC module drivers.

The EPICS drivers and device support for individual CAMAC modules
are included in this package. The following table provides a list
of module. See the sections on each application for further details.

Module          Db definition    Db Templates   Libraries      Source
------         -------------    -------------   ------------   -------
Crate Verifier  CV.dbd          CV.template     CVlib 		CVApp
SAM             SAM.dbd         SAM.template    SAMlib		SAMApp
IDIM            IDIM.dbd        IDIM.template   IDIMlib		IDIMApp
PIOP            PIOP.dbd        PIOP.template   PIOPlib 	PIOPApp

Additional 
-----------
CAM Library					CAMRoutines	CAMRoutineApp
		genSubRoutine.dbd		genSub

Note:
-----
In Epics version R3.14.10 the genSubRoutine will be replaced with aSubRoutine

CVApp
-------
The CVApp is the CAMAC Crate Verifier Module Application, which
consists of the EPICS driver and device support for this module as
well as database templates. Use of this module by an IOC Application
requires the users to add the library CVLib and the database definitions
file CV.dbd to your application. When defining the database for an application
there user can create a database substitution file using the database
template CV.template.

IDIMApp
--------

PIOPApp
--------

SAMApp
-------
The SAMApp is the CAMAC Smart-Analog-Module (SAM) Application, which
consists of the EPICS driver and device support for this module as well
as database template.  Use of this module by an IOC Application
requires the users to add the library SAMLib and the database definitions
file SAM.dbd to your application. When defining the database for an application
there user can create a database substitution file using the database
template SAM.template
