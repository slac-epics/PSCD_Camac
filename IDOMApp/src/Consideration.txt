This is no reason to support F22 A0/1 command which does checksum and OUTPUT checksum.
And not so usefuly to support F1 to read status, F27 to test status.
SLC system does not support them as well.

Three types of records will be supported:

mbbiDirect to read setting, F0A0/1

mbboDirect to set (F16, F18, F21, F19, F23) A0/1
F17 A0/1 is going thru mbboDirect as well.
One can have multi instances of F17 record which take input link from calc.

bo to reset (F9) and clear (F10)

Not all supported record are used.

For mbboDirect, only F18/F21 are used for level set and F17 is used for pulse.
